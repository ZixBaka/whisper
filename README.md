# Whisper

## Overview
Whisper is an open-source productivity tool that aggregates chats from various messaging platforms (such as Telegram, Instagram, etc.) into one unified interface. Users can categorize chats under custom tags (e.g., Work, Family, Social) and apply productivity modes (such as Work Time, Sleep Time) to control and manage distractions. Additionally, users can set up **auto-responses** for specific tags, ensuring that their contacts receive an automated reply during busy times.

The goal is to help users streamline their communication by focusing on what matters most during specific times of the day while automating responses to less important conversations.

## Features
- **Unified Chat Interface**: Connect and access chats from multiple platforms in one place.
- **Custom Tags**: Group your chats based on custom tags (e.g., Work, Social, Family).
- **Productivity Modes**: Control when and what chats are visible or muted, depending on your mode (Work Time, Sleep Time, etc.).
- **Auto-Response**: Automatically reply to incoming messages when in a specific mode or tag (e.g., "I'm currently busy, I'll get back to you later").
- **Notifications**: Get notifications only for relevant chats while muting distractions.
